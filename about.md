This site is a collection of notes that I have accumulated over the years, and
serves as a personal knowledge base to <strike>occasionally</strike> frequently
remind myself of things that have grown rusty in my mind with each passing year, 
and as a handy reference whenever my children have a programming or design 
question. I have also included source code with solutions from USACO problems 
and projects from various MOOCS that I have labored over with my children while 
teaching them the joys of programming.

I share them with you with the hope that you may find them useful in your
programming endeavours.
