Write a program RandomWalkers.java that takes two integer command-line 
arguments _r_ and _trials_. In each of _trials_ independent 
experiments, simulate a random walk until the random walker is at 
Manhattan distance _r_ from the starting point. Print the average 
number of steps. 

```
~/Desktop/loops> java RandomWalkers 5 1000000
average number of steps = 14.98188

~/Desktop/loops> java RandomWalkers 5 1000000
average number of steps = 14.93918

~/Desktop/loops> java RandomWalkers 10 100000
average number of steps = 59.37386

~/Desktop/loops> java RandomWalkers 20 100000
average number of steps = 235.6288

~/Desktop/loops> java RandomWalkers 40 100000
average number of steps = 949.14712

~/Desktop/loops> java RandomWalkers 80 100000
average number of steps = 3775.7152

~/Desktop/loops> java RandomWalkers 160 100000
average number of steps = 15113.61108
```

As _r_ increases, we expect the random walker to take more and more steps. 
But how many more steps? Use RandomWalkers.java to formulate a hypothesis 
as to how the average number of steps grows as a function of _r_.

Estimating an unknown quantity by generating random samples and aggregating 
the results is an example of Monte Carlo simulation â€” a powerful 
computational technique that is used widely in statistical physics, 
computational finance, and computer graphics.

### Solution:
```java
public class RandomWalkers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int r = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        final int trials = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);

        double random;
        int totalSteps = 0;
        for (int trial = 0; trial < trials; trial++) {
            int x = 0;
            int y = 0;
            int steps = 0;
            int distance = 0;
            while ((r > 0) && (distance != r)) {
                random = Math.random();
                if (random < 0.25) {
                    x -= 1;
                } else if (random < 0.50) {
                    x += 1;
                } else if (random < 0.75) {
                    y -= 1;
                } else {
                    y += 1;
                }
                steps++;

                // calculate new manhattan distance
                distance = Math.abs(x) + Math.abs(y);
            }
            totalSteps += steps;
        }
        System.out.println("average number of steps = " + (double) totalSteps / (double) trials);
    }
}
```
